If you are wondering what's the thing I'm trying to present you. Let's stay with me a couple more minutes. The whole idea of _envdoctor_ is that often – especially when do you work on a complicated project with many dependencies – there is a need for someone or even better something to tell you what's wrong with your setup. I've realized that across the community, many CLI tools has its own version of _help_ script, or _doctor_ how they call it. That brought me an idea that I'd be good to try to build a framework to make it easier.

So that's basically it. The framework for building doctor script for your project or even applications leveraging simple configuration.
