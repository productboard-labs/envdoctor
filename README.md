## Introduction

> ⚠️ This is very early stage of the project. I've put it together literally in a few hours. Use on your own risk.

This is a framework for easy creation of a set of checks to ensure that environment is correctly set up.

It's kind of like ESLint for your environment.

## Install

`yarn add @envdoctor/core -D`

### Packages

| Package                                  | Stable                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@envdoctor/core`                        | [![Version][envdoctor-core-version]][envdoctor-core-package]                           |
| `@envdoctor/utils`                       | [![Version][envdoctor-utils-version]][envdoctor-utils-package]                         |
| `@envdoctor/envdoctor-config-essentials` | [![Version][envdoctor-config-essentials-version]][envdoctor-config-essentials-package] |

## Configuration

First you have to create a configuration file:

- .doctorrc file in JSON or YAML format
- .doctorrc.json file
- .doctorrc.yaml, .doctorrc.yml, or .doctorrc.js file
- doctor.config.js file exporting a JS object

Let's use `.doctorrc.js` as in the `example/` folder

```js
module.exports = {
  extends: ["essentials"],
  rules: {
    "yarn-version": [2, "1.9.0"],
    "node-version": [2, "v8"]
  }
};
```

> for `essentials` please install `@envdoctor/envdoctor-config-essentials` package

Then we can add script into `package.json`

```json
...
"scripts": {
  "doctor": "envdoctor"
},
...
```

Now you should be able to run

`yarn run doctor`

and you would get (if you pass the test :) )

```
✔ Check Node version
✔ Check Yarn version
```

### Advanced configuration

#### extends

You can use either name (string) which should match installed package.

- @scoped (will be resolved as @scoped/envdoctor-config)
- @scoped/package-name (will be resolved as @scoped/envdoctor-config-package-name with a fallback to @scoped/package-name)
- package-name (will be resolved as envdoctor-config-package-name with a fallback to package-name)

You can also pass your own configuration as an object for example `extends: [@envdoctor/essentials", require("./doctor")]`. See `/example` implementation for more details.

#### rules

Every defined rule is automatically checked. You can change this with syntax

```
 "yarn-version": 0, // disable rule; [0], "off", "disable" acts the same
```

or you can change severity of the rule to "warn" by

```
 "yarn-version": [1, "1.9.0"], // you can also use "warn", ["warn] acts the same
```

### Implementation of your own rule

This is actually really similar to the example above

```js
function ownRuleImplementation(arg) {
   return "Failed Hello " + arg;
}

ownRuleImplementation.description = "This is just example"

...

rules {
 "own-rule": [2, "World", ownRuleImplementation],
 ...
}
```

> static `description` field could be also a function to get the same arguments as the check itself. Could be convenient for generic checks. (Check the `testPort.js` implementation in `/example`)

As you can see, if the function returns string, it means the check failed and the string is used as reason. To pass the check please return undefined, or boolean / true.

### Make your own configuration

Configuration is basically a JSON object which defines the rules. Check the `@envdoctor/envdoctor-config-essentials` implementation for example.

# Usage

Just add `envdoctor` to your `package.json`

```json
"scripts": {
  "doctor": "envdoctor"
}
```

And you are set!
